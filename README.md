                                                              BACK END ASSIGNMENT 

Question 1) program which checks if a string has balanced parenthesis.
            A balanced parenthesis string starts with an opening character ((, [, {), 
            ends with a matching closing character (), ], } respectively), and has only other matching parenthesis in between.


Question 2 - Build a simple reusable voting system in Python (django) e.g. given a list of 10 Bollywood movies, pick the top 5 that you like and submit the vote.

            > The infrastructure should be reusable across multiple voting system such activities like given a 20 cricketers pick the team of your choice
            > No person can vote more than once.
            > There is no user registration or login or authentication required.  It should a general online survey portal.
            > The workflow should be simple: If first time user and has not voted, take the user to the voting page and show him the list of movies. Once he chooses 5 movies and clicks 
                on vote Button take him to the trends page. If the user has already voted and visits the site, then directly take him to the trends page
            > Trends page contains all the list of movies, its corresponding total vote count and percentage values (total votes for a movie * 100/ overall votes done in the full survey)
            > Use Postgres or Mysql database
            > You can use Django templating or Jinja templating or AngularJS or any of JS frameworks for the client side
